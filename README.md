This generates some typescript packages for using kubernetes CRDs with pulumi.
I built this for my personal use and ease of homelab development. If you want a better repo for this see
[This pulumiverse repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/crds/crd-alertmanagerconfigs.yaml)
and the [pulumiverse packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40pulumiverse) on npm. I will try and contribute some of
these back to that repo as this is a fork of that to push to my personal repo.
